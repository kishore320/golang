I started learning GO language and capturing all the coding that is done as a part of this learning under this project.
## Getting Started
1) Download and Install Go : https://golang.org/doc/install
2) Setup your Go workspace : https://golang.org/doc/code.html
3) Clone the project into "src" directory of your workspace (Note that if you want, you can skip step #2 and clone the project into any directoy. But make sure to setup GOPATH, GOROOT, GOBIN environment variable appropriately)

$ **git clone https://github.com/kishore320/golang.git**
4) Thats it! You are ready to run the code samples available in the repo. For example, to run basics.go (from the cloned directory) just type

$ **go run basics/basics.go**
