## Why use Go ?
- It is a system level programming language with modern standard library (suited for modern world of computing with efficiency: cloud etc.).
- It is fast, simple, powerful and safe. 
- Faster builds (typically less than a second or two). Go's efficient, clean, simple dependency managment makes this possible.
- It has native concurrency support. goroutines and channels (go concurrency constructs) are primitive to the language.
- It has Garbage Collection (manages memory)
- Functions are first class citizens (objects are first class citizens in Java).
- Supports all the major OSs and has good cross-platform support.
- It is open source, getting developed rapidly and has good community support
- Backed by GOOGLE
- TIOBE index ranked 18th popular language in 2017 (opposed to 44th in 2016)

## Some of the issues with Go :
- Lack of third party libraries
